# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Hi, my name is Paweł (Paul) Kwaczyński and I'm going to learn programming in Python to work with AI and ML.
In the future, I want to use my knowledge to solve problems faced by specific groups of people or entire areas, such as medicine.
